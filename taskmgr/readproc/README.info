This is a library package for working on the 
/proc directory.
It is build for looking after Jobs wich are running,
e.g. for a watching daemon or something like that.

The methods, wich may be used are
	short int is_present(char * jobname)
	wich searches after a job with the name jobname
	and
	struct Root * read_proc(void)
	wich reads the /proc directory especially the
	/proc/<pid>/status file.

I designed this Library because I heared of a lot of 
people, wich liked to have some kind of procps for C
and not for the command line.

Read the code if you want to know how it works.
